					<p class = "description" id="ed"> what appeals to me the most about education is that it is the one sustainable way out of poverty. It not only gives you the ability to achieve your dreams, but it also broadens your horizons and empowers you to <span class="bold">dream bigger</span>.</p>
					<p id="design">I look up - it's 10pm. I look up a moment later - it's 3am.
						<br><br>
					This is what happens when I'm designing. I get lost in this alternate universe and the world around me could be in havoc and I wouldn't know.
					<br><br>Nothing makes me feel more alive than designing - the first steps of creating something new, something <span class="bold">reimagined</span> ... </p>
					<p id="climbing">I could be having a horrible day. But when I'm on the wall, the only things going through my head are which rock I'm going to reach for next, how I need to position my weight, the different ways I could compensate for my lack of height ... When I'm on the wall, I'm <span class="bold">focused</span>, and I'm <span class="bold">free</span>. Free from the stress of expectations, uncertainties, and doubts. Clearing my head and really <span class="bold">feeling each moment</span>.</p>
					<p id="photography"><span class="bold">" this is what I look like when I'm laughing ... "</span>
					<br><br>
					Before college, I had never seen myself laugh. My first year at MIT someone took a candid photo of me laughing. 
					I was shocked - I looked so different. 
					Since then I've been obsessed with showing people what they look like when they're completely off guard, comfortable, and <span class="bold">happy</span>. 
					So many people fear getting their photos taken, what they don't know is that everyone is photogenic when they're laughing, when they're happy and carefree. <br><br> 
					That's always my aim: <span class="bold">to capture these beautiful moments</span>.</p>
					<p id="singing">when there's a good beat, I have to dance. When there's a song I know, I have to sing along. Something within me just refuses to be contained <span class="heart">&#9829</span></p>
					<p id="humans">we're all so different, but at the same time, <span class="bold">in a fundamental way we're all so similar</span>. I love discovering the depth of people, the depth of humanity. It kills me to learn about tragedies, but it also makes me think deeper about the human condition. Why do we do what we do, and behave the way we behave? What are the invisible forces that shape and influence us? Can we be changed on a more fundamental level and if so - how?</p>

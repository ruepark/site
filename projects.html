				<p><span class="bold">as project lead</span>, I led our team of five from <span class="bold">ideation</span> to <span class="bold">user research</span> to <span class="bold">prototyping</span> an iOS and webapp tool that relies on existing friend and family networks to promote mental health.</p>
				<p>other projects I worked on with DFA include a modified clicker system which better gauges student understanding in the classroom, and a tool to help teachers collaborate more effectively.</p>

					 is a MOOC - Massive Open Online Course - Platform started by MIT and Harvard to make college education from top universities such as MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley <span class="bold">free and accessible</span> to all through video lectures and homework problems assigned and graded online. I worked in the research division, using data collected from edx users to identify patterns and analyze behavior.
				</div>
				<div class="info-text">
					<p>previously the lab discovered a cheating phenomenon that only happens in MOOC environments which they coined CAMEO [Copying Answers Using Multiple Existences Online]. CAMEO involved students creating more than one account to attempt homework and exam problems, harvesting correct answers to input into their primary account.</p>
					<p><span class="bold">as a researcher</span> in the lab, I worked on pursuing an interesting theory. A PhD student in the lab discovered that although most CAMEO users scored high on CAMEO-able questions and low on non-CAMEO-able questions, the highest scoring users on both parameters were also CAMEO users. This led to the question: <span class="bold"> do certain approaches to "cheating" in online learning environments lead to higher learning gains?</span></p>
					<p>thus began my many weeks of <span class="bold">data analysis</span>, using Google Bigquery, STATA and Gephi to visualize and identify patterns in student habits and their associated content mastery levels.</p>

Our pilot sites include Mbeya Tanzania and Kisumu Kenya.

				<div class="info-text">
					<p>we partnered with FLE [Foundation for Learning Equality], OLE [Open Learning Exchange], MIT TATA Center, MIT Ideas Global Challenge, and Rotary International, to host resources such as Khan Academy and Wikipedia on raspberry pis to allow rural locations with <span class="bold">no internet or power</span> to access the multitude of available resources available here. 1room hopes to be a cheap alternative to government schools that creates effective learning hubs for underserved populations in developing countries. Underserved populations include adult learners, the poor, and populations residing in rural areas. <span class="bold">as chief technology officer</span> I led a small team of engineers at MIT to develop both hardware and software used at our pilot sites. </p>

				<div class="info-text">
					<p> <span class="bold">as an organizer</span> I orchestrated the Undergrad Hack [2014] which had representation from over 20 different colleges, and the Rehabilitation Hack [2015] where we partnered with Spaulding Hospital to plan and execute a hackathon at the Cambridge Innovation Center. I additionally contributed to the planning and execution of numerous other healthcare hackathons hosted by MIT Hacking Medicine. </p>
					<p> <span class="bold">as a participant</span> I formed a team with physicians at Children's during the Pediatric Hack [2014] to develop the idea and design for Genetiscripts. Genetiscripts uses patient genomic data to enhance EMRs and help prevent misdiagnoses. </p>
